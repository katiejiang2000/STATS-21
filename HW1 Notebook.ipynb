    "(A) In a print statement, what happens if you leave out one of the parentheses, or both? What kind of error messages does Python produce for these mistakes?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** If you leave out a parenthesis, Python detects a syntax error, and the code will not execute. If you leave out both parentheses, Python will produce a message that says \"Missing parentheses in call to 'print'.\" If you leave out one parenthesis, Python will produce a message that says \"unexpected EOF\" or \"invalid syntax.\""

    "**Answer:** If you leave out the opening quotation mark, Python mistakenly reads the string as variable names. Therefore, the code will not execute if Python can't find variables with the names we supplied. The error messages say \"invalid syntax\" or \"name is not defined\". If you leave out the closing quotation mark, Python will detect that your string is unfinished and produce an error message that says \"EOL when scanning string literal.\""

    "\n",
    "**Answer:** Spaces do not make a difference here. Python will read the operators as if the spaces were not there. When you put several + or - operators in a row, Python will evaluate `+ -` and `- +` as `-`, and `++` and `--` as `+`. Something like `3 - - - - - 2` has five minus signs, so it will return the same value as `3 - 2`. Something like `3-*-2` will throw an \"invalid syntax\" error because Python expects a number to follow the first `-` it reads."
